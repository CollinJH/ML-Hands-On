Predicting Housing Prices

This a typical supervised learning task, the model can be trained with labeled examples

each instance comes with an expected output

this is a typical regression task
also univariate - predicting a single value
multiple values would be multivariate

no need to adjust to changing data rapidly and the data is small
so batch learning will work fine
